Hi! I am a Data Scientist working with [Deloitte Consulting LLP](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/services/consulting.html), I work with Fortune Technology 10 clients to help them make data-driven (read profitable) decisions. Prior to this I have worked with startups across India to build Social Media Analytics Dashboards, Chatbots, Recommendation Engines and Forecasting Models. 

My core interest lie in NLP, Machine Learning/ Statistics and Product development.

If Data is what floats your boat, then coffee is on me! :D
